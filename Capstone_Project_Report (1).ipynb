    "The purpose of this project was to identify areas in London with low number of restaurants in order to help stakeholders in narrowing down the search for optimal location for a new restaurant. By calculating restaurant density distribution from Foursquare data we have first identified general boroughs that justify further analysis, and then generated extensive collection of locations which satisfy some basic requirements regarding existing nearby restaurants. Clustering of those locations was then performed in order to create major zones of interest (containing greatest number of potential locations) and addresses of those zone centers were created to be used as starting points for final exploration by stakeholders.\n",
